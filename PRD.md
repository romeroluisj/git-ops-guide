## 1. Purpose & Vision

Build a personal, shareable **Git/GitHub practice handbook** repository that
Windows developers working with GitHub and Azure DevOps can use as a daily
quick-reference and a safe hands-on learning environment.

The repo functions as **both** a documentation center and a sandbox practice environment.

---

## 2. Target Audience

- **Primary** — Windows developers at the same organization (coworkers).
- **Secondary** — onboarding engineers new to Git/GitHub/Azure DevOps.
- **Environment** — Windows (PowerShell, Git Bash, batch scripts), GitHub,
  Azure DevOps.

---

## 3. Goals

1. Document the most practical, everyday Git and GitHub commands for Windows developers.
2. Cover the full lifecycle: setup → clone/init → daily loop → branching →
   PRs → merge → release.
3. Provide an "In Case of Emergency" section for the most common mistakes
   and how to fix them.
4. Include a sandbox folder so coworkers can safely practice the full
   remote-to-local-to-remote loop.
5. Demonstrate skills employers look for: Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Pull
   Requests, Branch Policies, CI/CD basics, and Release Management.
6. Be immediately useful as a reference — not just a one-time tutorial.

---

## 4. Non-Goals

- This repo does **not** clone or wholesale copy existing cheat sheets.
- This repo does **not** target macOS or Linux as a primary platform.
- This repo does **not** implement a live CI/CD system; it documents how to
  set one up.

---

## 5. Branch Naming Convention (Project-Wide Rule)

> **New repos:** always use `main` as the default branch.
> **Existing repos:** the default branch may be `main` or `master` — check
> before assuming.

All documentation and command examples in this repo reference both `main`
and `master` where the distinction matters.

---

## 6. Platform Assumptions (IMPORTANT)

> **All commands in this repo assume Windows.**
> Shell targets (in order of preference):
>
> 1. **PowerShell** (modern, recommended for Azure/GitHub CLI usage)
> 2. **Git Bash** (bundled with Git for Windows — good for Unix-style commands)
> 3. **Command Prompt / Batch** (`.bat` / `.cmd` files; legacy but still
>    common in enterprises)

When a command differs meaningfully across these shells, all variants are provided.

  log/diff, stash, undo, and GitHub CLI commands.
- Organized by task, not by command name.
- Windows shell variants noted where they differ.

## 9. Sandbox Exercise Design

The `/sandbox` folder is a safe practice area. Exercise flow for coworkers:

1. Clone this repo (`git clone <url>`).
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b practice/your-name`.
3. Add a markdown file inside `/sandbox/` (e.g., `your-name-notes.md`).
4. Commit and push: `git push origin practice/your-name`.
5. Open a Pull Request targeting `main`.
6. Practice the PR review + merge flow.
7. Optionally: intentionally create a merge conflict and resolve it.

---

## 10. Scripts Requirements

All scripts live in `scripts/windows/` and must work on Windows with no
additional dependencies beyond Git for Windows, PowerShell 5.1+, and
optionally GitHub CLI.

- **`setup-git-config.ps1`** (PowerShell) — set `user.name`, `user.email`,
  default editor, and line endings.
- **`new-feature-branch.ps1`** (PowerShell) — prompt for branch name,
  checkout main, pull, create branch, push.
- **`sync-main.ps1`** (PowerShell) — checkout main/master, pull latest, and
  report divergence.
- **`setup-git-config.bat`** (Batch) — same as the `.ps1` version, for
  environments where PowerShell is restricted.

---

## 11. GitHub Repository Settings (When Published)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Default branch | `main` |
| Branch protection on `main` | Require PR, 1 reviewer, status checks |
| PR template | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` |
| Issues | Enabled (for coworkers to suggest additions) |
| Wiki | Disabled (docs live in `/docs`) |
| License | MIT |

## 13. Success Criteria

- [ ] A coworker with zero Git experience can follow `docs/00-setup.md`
      through `docs/02-daily-loop.md` and make their first commit and PR.
- [ ] A developer can find and apply any "emergency fix" in under 2 minutes
      using `docs/07-emergency-fixes.md`.
- [ ] All PowerShell scripts run without modification on a stock Windows
      10/11 machine with Git for Windows installed.
- [ ] The repo itself demonstrates good Git hygiene: meaningful commits,
      feature branches, PR template in use.
- [ ] CI workflow passes on every PR to `main`.

---

## 14. Out of Scope (v1)

- macOS / Linux command variants (may be added in v2 as a secondary reference).
- GitLab or Bitbucket workflows.
- Advanced topics: git bisect, submodules, worktrees, signed commits (may be
  added in v2).
- A live deployed site (GitHub Pages) — possible v2 enhancement.
